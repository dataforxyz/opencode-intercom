# OpenCode Intercom

OpenCode Intercom is an OpenCode plugin that speaks the same local intercom
protocol as `pi-intercom`, `codex-intercom`, and `claude-intercom`.

It gives OpenCode native intercom tools and lets OpenCode participate in the
same local multi-agent mesh as Pi, Codex, and Claude sessions.

## What It Does

- registers the current OpenCode session with the shared local broker
- lists Pi, Codex, Claude, and OpenCode peers
- sends and receives inter-agent messages
- supports blocking ask/reply flows
- injects inbound messages back into OpenCode so the receiving session can wake
  up and continue from the message

## Status

Protocol-v3 compatible with Pi Intercom 0.7 and the matching Codex/Claude adapters.

Proven working:

- OpenCode plugin loads in real `opencode run`
- startup registration works without needing an intercom tool call first
- fresh Pi and Codex peers can be reached from OpenCode
- fresh OpenCode receivers can be reached from Pi
- busy headless `opencode run` receivers can wake after their current turn
  finishes
- verified exactly-once inbound delivery in headless run mode

- delivery is complete only after OpenCode confirms prompt injection
- sends survive reconnects in a durable sender outbox and replay with the same ID
- incompatible older brokers are detected and replaced safely
- ask defer/cancel controls are broker-acknowledged, and timed-out asks remain late-replyable

## Install From This Checkout

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Add the server plugin to your normal OpenCode config (usually
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    "/path/to/opencode-intercom/dist/plugin.mjs"
  ]
}
```

To add the native intercom picker and copy command, put the separate TUI plugin in
`~/.config/opencode/tui.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/tui.json",
  "plugin": [
    "/path/to/opencode-intercom/dist/tui.mjs"
  ]
}
```

OpenCode keeps server and TUI plugins in separate configuration files. Do not
put `dist/tui.mjs` in `opencode.json`: the server plugin loader will reject it.
Restart OpenCode after changing either config.

The TUI plugin talks to the already-connected server plugin through a private
local control bridge. It does not open another broker connection or register a
second intercom identity. Both plugin entries are therefore required for the
native commands.

No wrapper alias is required for OpenCode: once both config files are present,
plain `opencode` has the shortcuts and slash commands. This differs from hosts
whose terminal wrappers are responsible for their keybindings.

## TUI Commands

| Action | Slash command | Shortcut |
|---|---|---|
| Choose a connected agent, compose, and send a message | `/intercom` | **Alt+M** |
| Copy this session's exact intercom target | `/intercom-id` | **Alt+I** |

`/intercom-contact` remains an alias for `/intercom-id`. The copy command uses
the identity owned by the server plugin, so it remains correct even when the
TUI and OpenCode server run in different processes. If no system clipboard
helper is installed, the target is displayed in a toast instead. Linux support
uses `wl-copy`, `xclip`, or `xsel`; macOS uses `pbcopy`, and Windows uses
`clip.exe`.

## Tools

- `intercom_whoami`: show this session's intercom ID, name, cwd, and model
- `intercom_status`: show connection status and pending message counts
- `intercom_list`: list local Pi, Codex, Claude, and OpenCode sessions
- `intercom_set_summary`: publish a short discoverable status
- `intercom_send`: send a non-blocking message
- `intercom_ask`: send a question and wait briefly for the target's reply
- `intercom_pending`: read queued inbound messages and unresolved asks
- `intercom_reply`: reply to a pending inbound ask

## Inbound Delivery Model

Inbound messages always reach the runtime queue. From there, the plugin tries to
deliver them into the active OpenCode session.

Current delivery strategy:

1. show a toast
2. if OpenCode is running with a real TUI, try prompt append + submit
3. if the target session is busy in headless/run mode, use `session.promptAsync`
4. if the busy-path delivery is not confirmed, keep a fallback queue
5. flush queued fallback messages on `session.idle`
6. acknowledge delivery to the broker only after injection succeeds
7. track delivered message IDs so a message is never injected twice

Protocol delivery has two states: `accepted` means the broker has assigned a
delivery ID; `delivered` means this receiver acknowledged successful injection.
The sender outbox is stored below the shared intercom runtime directory and is
replayed automatically after reconnect.

That means busy `opencode run` sessions can now receive a real follow-up turn
after their original tool call completes.

## Quick Verification

Start a long-lived receiver:

```bash
OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT='{"$schema":"https://opencode.ai/config.json","plugin":["/path/to/opencode-intercom/dist/plugin.mjs"],"permission":{"bash":"allow"}}' \
OPENCODE_INTERCOM_NAME=opencode-live-test \
OPENCODE_INTERCOM_SESSION_ID=opencode-live-test \
opencode run --auto --format json "Run bash command sleep 60. Then output done. Do not call any intercom tools."
```

Confirm it registered from Pi:

```bash
PI_INTERCOM_SESSION_ID=pi-list-test \
pi --no-extensions --extension /path/to/pi-intercom/index.ts --no-skills --mode json --print "Use the intercom tool with action list once. Output only the tool result."
```

Send a message from Pi while the receiver is still in `sleep`:

```bash
PI_INTERCOM_SESSION_ID=pi-send-test \
pi --no-extensions --extension /path/to/pi-intercom/index.ts --no-skills --mode json --print "Use the intercom tool with action send to send this exact message to opencode-live-test: hello from pi live test. Output only the tool result."
```

Then inspect the receiver session:

```bash
opencode export <session-id>
```

Expected result:

- the original `sleep` turn finishes
- a new user turn appears with the inbound intercom text
- the inbound prompt appears exactly once

## Debugging

Enable inject-path logging with:

```bash
OPENCODE_INTERCOM_DEBUG=1
```

When enabled, the plugin writes structured injection logs to:

```bash
/tmp/intercom-inject.log
```

Useful things to inspect there:

- whether the receiver was busy
- whether TUI injection was skipped because the run was headless
- whether `session.promptAsync` returned `204`
- whether delivery was recorded exactly once

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OPENCODE_INTERCOM_NAME` | Discoverable session name |
| `OPENCODE_INTERCOM_SESSION_ID` | Stable intercom id |
| `OPENCODE_INTERCOM_MODEL` | Model label shown to peers |
| `OPENCODE_INTERCOM_DEBUG` | Enable `/tmp/intercom-inject.log` diagnostics when set to `1` |
| `PI_INTERCOM_ASK_TIMEOUT_MS` | Shared default blocking-ask timeout, max 120000 |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Shared broker socket/config base, default `~/.pi/agent` |
